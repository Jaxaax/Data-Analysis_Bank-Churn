# Data-Analysis_Bank-Churn

  # Project Introduction
This is the individual final project of the course BUSQOM 1080 DATA ANALYSIS FOR BUSINESS during undergraduate years at Pitt.

The dataset BankChurners_edited.csv was originally retrieved from https://zenodo.org/records/4322342#.Y8OsBdJBwUE, and edited with the Naive Bayes classifier removed as the data source suggested.

Source codes are available in .rmd and results in .html

The pdf document is a more detailed report with detailed interpretations and the source codes in the appendix.
